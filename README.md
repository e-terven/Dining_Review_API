# DiningReview_API

I utilized Spring to develop a Java-based RESTful API implementation for constructing web APIs with CRUD functionality.

#### Project Objectives:
- Construct a RESTful web API with data persistence using Spring and Spring Data JPA
- Use Spring Initializr to generate the initial Java project
- Configure application properties for certain **dependencies**, including the H2 embedded database  
 ----   
- Define the **entities** that comprise this application scenario
- Define the **repositories** that enable creating, updating, and querying these different entities
- Define the **API contracts** that will enable this application scenario
- Leverage the convenience of **Lombok**  
 ----   
- Use **cURL** to test your API scenarios
 ----

The project includes a few new techniques I researched on my own:
